# Roles
On the installation of Document Manager a number of default roles are included.

All users of the Hornbill Platform, regardless of the application, must possess the "User Role". To use, and interact with, the Hornbill Document Manager app, a user must also be allocated one of the app-specific roles listed below. If the need arises, it is possible to create custom roles to suit a specific requirement.
