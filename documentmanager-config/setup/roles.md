# Roles
On the installation of Document Manager a number of default roles are included.

All users of the Hornbill Platform, regardless of the application, must possess the "User Role". To use, and interact with, the Hornbill Document Manager app, a user must also be allocated one of the app-specific roles listed below. If the need arises, it is possible to create custom roles to suit a specific requirement.

## Before you Begin
* Have an understanding of how [roles are managed](/esp-config/organizational-data/roles)
::: tip
 Assigning a role with a privilege level of `user` or higher to a user can automatically allocate a Service Manager subscription license to that user.

## System Roles
System roles are provided when Document Manager is installed or updated.  These roles can not be modified, other than assigning users to the roles.
